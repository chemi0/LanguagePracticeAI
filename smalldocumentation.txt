(1) hover over words for quick translation / clicking is more descriptive + tts
for sentences it will be something like this : "Hello , my name is Connor. *" pressing the * would bring up a window with a scroll wheel with the translation of the sentence , split it into segments , each segment will have (1)
-prompts
-2nd gemini if the same one doesnt work properly (but it should)
-hover/pressing events

Bugs to fix :

- TTS plays for the prompt message when you open the program without pressing it 
- When you change from language to another language sometimes the prompt in the message box disappears
- There was something else but I forgot to type it out and now I can't remember

Additional :

- Change from 10s of recording to button press - button press for a better user experience
- This model is relatively slow , try the whisper v3 basic , this one should be faster but people say it tends to not describe correctly rarely
