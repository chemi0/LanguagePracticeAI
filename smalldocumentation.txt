things to fix in testing:
** the translation hover sometimes gets confused about the language for some reason;
** the button for tts sometimes just disappears randomly while swapping languages?
** the AI's greeting sometimes just disappears randomly while swapping languages/personalities?
** translation seems to be working fine , tts speaks out just fine in the correct annoying tts accent for every language , the gemini explanation works just fine , but its a bit clunky for Japanese , look for alts
